# CLAUDE.md - Clinequal Context

## Company

Clinequal is a healthcare AI startup that detects, quantifies, and corrects bias in clinical trial data.

## Problem

Over 80% of clinical trials have biased datasets. Women, elderly, children, and ethnic minorities are systematically underrepresented in medical research.

This causes:

- Drugs that pass trials but fail in real-world populations
- Protocol amendments costing €500K+ each
- Blocked or delayed regulatory approval
- Perpetuated healthcare inequalities

Current tools (EDC software, data cleaning utilities) are not designed to detect or address these biases. The problem remains invisible until it becomes expensive.

## Solution

End-to-end platform for clinical trial data quality:

- **Detect** demographic underrepresentation and systematic biases
- **Quantify** bias severity with statistical fairness metrics
- **Explain** where and why bias exists (explainable AI)
- **Correct** through rebalancing strategies and targeted recruitment guidance
- **Simulate** alternative scenarios before committing resources
- **Report** audit-ready documentation for EMA/FDA compliance

## Customers

Primary: Pharmaceutical companies and Contract Research Organizations (CROs) who run clinical trials and bear the cost of failures.

Secondary: Academic medical centers, hospital research departments, regulatory bodies.

## Business Model

SaaS subscription. €20K/year per clinical trial for enterprise customers. Freemium access for academic researchers.

## Market

- TAM: €143B global clinical trial data analytics by 2030
- SAM: €29.4B European segment
- Target: €100M ARR in 5 years (5,000 trials)

## Differentiation

Competitors like CluePoints, Inato, and Unlearn.AI offer monitoring or recruitment optimization. None provide integrated bias detection, correction, simulation, and regulatory reporting.

## Stage

Pre-seed. MVP validated on public datasets. University of Naples Federico II partnership. Fit4Start finalist (top 15 of 495). Seeking €215K seed round.

## Team

Five co-founders covering AI/ML research, software engineering, regulatory expertise (EU AI Act contributor), design/branding, and finance/ESG.

## One-Liner

Clinequal makes clinical trials representative, compliant, and faster by detecting and correcting data bias before it costs millions.
